# Pong
Game was developed with 3D view using a Z-buffer

<strong>In HUMAN-COMPUTER mode(given from the start, to come back press the key "1"):</strong>

- you can change view perspective of the field
- There are given hints, when the ball is near the wall of player, there is shadow where it's going to hit the wall
- Panel control keys = W,A,S,D 
- Changing view = arrow keys

<strong>In HUMAN-HUMAN mode(for turning on this mode press key "2"):</strong>

- you CAN'T change view perspective of the field, hence it is visible for two players
- There are given hints, when the ball is near the wall of player, there is shadow where it's going to hit the wall
- Panel control keys for the first player = W,A,S,D 
- Panel control keys for the second player = arrow keys
